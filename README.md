# Terminology

The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. 
As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. 
In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, 
so the snake continually gets longer as it moves. 
In another common scheme, the snake has a specific length, 
so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head. 
The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, 
other obstacle, or itself. This is developed using the concept of 
sliding window of data structures.
